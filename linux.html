          <h2>Linux</h2>
              <p>I have been using Linux as my daily driver since early 2021, so that makes it about four years in the time of writing this.<br>
            back in 2021 I started with Ubuntu Studio (a fork of Kubuntu with creative programs preinstalled) but after a month or so moved to Arch Linux because of problems I experienced with Ubuntu.<br>
            The leap was a bit scary because of the reputation of Arch Linux online, but after a while I thought I never want to go back. I feel like I am really in control and AUR has almost all the programs I need.<br>
            Currently I am running Arch Linux on both my Desktop PC and my study laptop. I haven't encountered any problems with programs, excluding Microsoft Office which I had to run inside a virtual machine.</p>

            <h3>My first touch with Linux</h3>
            <p>I used linux for the first time when I was in elementary school. There was a LTSP program in some elementary schools in Finland where they installed Ubuntu on a main server PC and the systems were network booted on client PC's<br>
               This allowed small schools to use their old low power hardware for a longer time. If I recall correctly the machines had ubuntu 7.10 to 9.10 (memory based on year, default wallpaper and installation cd cover) </p>

            <h3>Experimental years</h3>
            <p>I have been experimenting with Linux at least since 2012 when I was 14 years old. I have pretty much always used some kind of Ubuntu, before moving to Arch in 2021.<br>
                I almost always had a laptop with Linux on it and did some experimentation on it. got to know the terminal and tested installing differrent programs and games on it.<br>
                The first time I really thought about moving to Linux was when Valve released Proton compability layer back in 2018, and suddenly so many more games worked on Linux<br>
                And I didn't have to install Windows version of steam through Wine to maybe make the games work (with bad success rate).</p>
